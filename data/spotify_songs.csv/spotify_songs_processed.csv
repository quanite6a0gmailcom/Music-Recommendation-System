Go for what you know don't let it slide, Take a change let's ride. To the future not to the past, Take it easy and not too fast. Many failed in society, To blind to see you need to be free. Free from the strain that causes pain, Pain is the name and life is the game. Dream on try to survive, Keep hope alive reach for the sky. Do the best you can make a wish come true, Listen here's the clue: Let it flow before it's all gone Come on boy you got to dream on. Try to relax and move to the track, Go for your goals and don't hold it back. Strive to keep you dreams and hopes alive, Do it now and don't pass it by. Life is to short so give me your hand I will lead you to another land. D. R. O. C. K. Is here with the light, Shinin' bright cause I'm right. Close your eyes and just concentrate, It's never to late to erase the hate. Focus your mind when I say my rhymes, Cause I'm always on time. Do the best you can make a wish come true, Listen here's the clue: Let it flow before it's all gone Come on boy you got to dream on Dreams are the way to express yourself from the heart Now it's time to depart. On a journey for the mind Peace of mind is what you will find. Like Martin Luther King, I had a dream, that we all would sing In peace and harmony comin' strong. Come on boy you got to dream on"

My IQ's the highest, likely Shoes are tied and tie is tidy And though he's a bit unsightly My professor's sure to like me! My name's Baldi! Greetings class! Test me, sir! I'm sure to pass!

I wanna play with someone! I've got nowhere to turn, I think this game is broken! Detention for you! I hear the doors you open!
